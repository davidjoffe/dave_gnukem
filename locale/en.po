#. TRANSLATORS: This is a pun on "Start new game". "Gnu" is an open-source reference.
#. If a similar pun works in your language, feel free to use it. Otherwise,
#. preferably translate as "Start new game", which has the advantage of being potentially more re-usable for other games

#. Humor menu item. TRANSLATORS: This is a negation of 'ordering info' (a joke menu item since it's open source) but also since it's a retro game, it's another retro 90s reference to 90's 'not!', while the joke 'Ordering info' menu item is there in the first place as a parody reference to the Shareware games like the original Duke Nukem we're parodying here, which had 'ordering info'
