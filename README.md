# Dave Gnukem
Dave Gnukem is a retro-style 2D scrolling platform shooter similar to, and inspired by, Duke Nukem 1 (~1991). The source code is cross-platform and open source. It runs on Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and more. (The original Duke Nukem 1 had 16-color EGA 320x200 graphics; the aim here is 'similar but different' gameplay and 'look and feel'. It is kind of a parody of the original. Please note it is not a 'clone', and not a 're-make'.)

**News Apr 2018: Version 1.0 released.** Apr 2019 OpenBSD port. (Apr 2020: Version 1.0.1 released.) (19 Nov 2022: 1.0.2 and 1.0.3 update to SDL2!)

### Who is to blame for this?

Created by: David Joffe https://djoffe.com/ / https://www.liveedu.tv/david_joffe/ / https://minds.com/David_Joffe

The project was originally created and maintained by David Joffe (~1994 to 2004, and Oct 2016 to present). It was maintained by EMH (Evil Mr Henry http://www.emhsoft.com/) from 2004 to 2008. Additional contributions by: [T.O.G](http://www.nuke24.net/ "T.O.G."), [Vytautas Shaltenis](https://rtfb.lt/), Kent Mein, Steve Merrifield, Felix Richter, Kevin Joffe. See also 'Additional Credits' below.

As of 8 Oct 2016, this project is under 'properly' active development again, and **on 3 Apr 2018, 'version 1.0' has been released**. (Note - this game wasn't 'retro genre' when I started it - it just took so long to complete that it's now 'de facto' "retro"! - David)

### About Duke Nukem 1

Duke Nukem 1 was a famous original 16-color 320x200 'classic' game released by Apogee Software in 1991 that launched the Duke Nukem series: https://goo.gl/yP4PbS  The original Duke Nukem 1 was created by Todd Replogle (co-creator of the Duke Nukem series), John Carmack (of id Software), Scott Miller (founder of 3D Realms), Allen H. Blum III, George Broussard, and Jim Norwood.

### Help Wanted: Packages for major Linux distros, e.g. Debian, Ubuntu etc.

It would be really great if someone could create packages for all major Linux distros (perhaps dual packages, i.e. one for data, one for binary? as licenses differ a bit .. or just one?)

### Notes

Note the aim of Dave Gnukem is not to be a 'clone', nor to try match DN1 gameplay precisely - the goal is to be 'similar but different', sort of a parody though not terribly funny. It's not the purpose or intention of this project to produce a 'clone', nor is it the intention to try load actual original level or sprite data into this 'engine'. The included levels have been created from scratch by users. The included sprites (apart from a few small exceptions mentioned at the bottom of this README) have been drawn by hand from scratch. The game is sort of a hat tip to the original. - David Joffe

## Gameplay Instructions

Try find the exit, while dodging or shooting monsters.

### Default Keys:

* Left/Right: Move left/right
* Ctrl: Jump
* Alt: Shoot
* Up Arrow: Action key (for e.g. opening doors, using teleporters or lifts, activating the exit, etc.)
* Escape: In-game menu

* 7/6: Increase/decrease volume
* Insert: Toggle sounds on/off
* Shift+F6/F7: Dec/Inc speed (framerate)
* Shift+F8/F9: Toggle map and sprite auto-shadows on/off, respectively
* F10 Save screenshot

To open doors, find the correct color key, and press the action key on the 'lock' nearby the door(s).

Power boots allow you to jump higher. The special molecule pickup gives you full health.

### Storyline/Plot:

The year is $CURRENTYEAR+8. An evil genius, Dr Proetton, has been hired by the CIA to infect the world's computers with a virus called SystemD, crippling them. Only you can stop him. You must find the floppy disk with the Devuan Antivirus on it, and install it on the master computer, which is hidden in Vault7.

*Any resemblance to actual persons or entities is purely coincidental*

TL;DR Shoot anything that moves

# Awards and Reviews

* "a good time killer when I'm baking" - Alessia_Amelia (Jan 2019)

# FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

* Q: 'The scrolling is choppy' or 'framerate low'?
* A: The code can handle smoother scrolling and faster frame rates by tweaking settings and gameplay code, but is deliberately soft-limited to 18 frames per second (and the scrolling behaviour intended to mimic the original) because the original DN1 behaved close to this, and the point is to offer a nostalgic similar retro 'look and feel' (and thus also frame rate and scrolling behaviour) of the original Duke Nukem 1, which was designed to run on the much slower computers of that era (I used to play DN1 on an 80286 with 16-color EGA graphics in the '90s, and if you've ever had to code for EGA you'd also understand - dj) - so that anyone who also played the original should experience some nostalgic familiarity.

* Q: Why is the game resolution 320x200?
* A: The original Duke Nukem 1 had 320x200 16-color EGA-mode graphics ("Enhanced Graphics Adapter", an early video standard that supported 16 colors; many games of the time used 320x200). Since this game is intended as a sort of 'retro parody' it deliberately uses the same original resolution (and frame rate) in order to offer some retro nostalgic recognition and familiarity in look and feel and gameplay, especially for those who played the original. (David Joffe note: The first computer I did 'serious' programming on was an 80286 with EGA display adapter in the 1990s, and I spent quite a lot of time playing the original Duke Nukem 1 - I loved the game - and around ~1994 I started working on a very early x86 assembly language DOS/EGA version of what went on to become Dave Gnukem when in ~1995 I started this C++ version. So this wasn't a retro game when I started it - it just took so long to complete it that by the time version 1 was completed, I noticed everyone was calling it a "retro game", so it's now de facto "retro". I felt during development that if one deviates from 320x200 it feels much less like a 'retro parody of Duke Nukem 1'.) The game source code can support higher resolutions - these are controlled by config options - so the 'engine' could be used to make higher-resolution games, and with higher frame rates and smoother scrolling (with some tweaking).

* Q: What does the "Don't quit" menu option do?
* A: It does just what it says, it doesn't quit the game

* Q: Why does it say "Ordering info" in the menu?
* A: A small parody and retro recognition item, because the original shareware Duke Nukem 1 had that in the menu - but since this is open source, we add a "not" right after that is [also very 1990s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/..._Not!)

* Add new high-voltage "barrier" that must be shot multiple times to destroy before hero can pass through (touching it results in immediate death)
* Add new monster that constitutes the approximate equivalent of DN1 rabbits (for now, or maybe permanently, this is just a sort of 'evil Tux' - not sure yet if placeholder sprite, or part of plot)

* Fix: Potential game 'freeze' in teleporter if exiting level editor (or holding in action key)
* Added "-scale N" command line option (1 = 320x200, 2=640x400, etc.) (if passed, this overrides the default behavior of attempting to "intelligently" select the scale factor based on e.g. desktop resolution etc.)
* Fix: "Key polling behavior is subtly incorrect" (this should slightly improve the character control, especially if trying to move left/right one block only)

# Developer Info / Build Info

**Dependencies: LibSDL2, LibSDL-Mixer 2**

## Windows Build Instructions

* Visual Studio 2010 project is included.
* **NB** You must set your Visual Studio 'Working Directory' to ../../ in order to run this (under Project / Properties / Configure Properties / Debugging) or it won't find the data files and just immediately exit on run
* If you get an error about not finding SDL DLL(s) when running, set 'Project / Properties / Configure Properties / Environment' to: PATH=c:\your\path\to\DLLs;%PATH%

## Linux Build Instructions

Either download the source code archive, or get the latest source code with git. Make sure the 'data' subfolder is also present.

The latest source code and data archives can be downloaded here (these should generally be stable and the best option to download):

https://github.com/davidjoffe/dave_gnukem/archive/master.zip
https://github.com/davidjoffe/gnukem_data/archive/master.zip (after extracting, rename this folder to just 'data' as that's what the game looks for)

GETTING THE LATEST SOURCE AND DATA FOLDER USING GIT:

To get the latest source with git, you need two repos, the source code, and the data, which must be exactly cloned into 'data' under the main folder:

$ git clone https://github.com/davidjoffe/dave_gnukem.git gnukem

$ cd gnukem

$ git clone https://github.com/davidjoffe/gnukem_data.git data

$ cd ..

BUILDING:

Type 'make'
(BSD variants: Try 'make -f Makefile.bsd' rather.)

Run with ./davegnukem if it built correctly (NB, it must find the 'data' folder)

NB: FIRST INSTALL DEPENDENCIES:

How to install dependencies on Debian, Ubuntu etc.:

$ sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev

$ sudo apt-get install libsdl2-mixer-dev

(NOTE: If you don't have libsdl-mixer1.2 for whatever reason and you just want to get it compiling without sound, you can add -DNOSOUND to the CCFLAGS in the Makefile, and remove -lSDL_mixer from the Makefile LIBS setting.)

## SDL1.2 or SDL2?

On 19 November 2022 we made an official change from LibSDL1.2 (now very old) to LibSDL2 (thanks to Matteo Bini for that).

https://github.com/davidjoffe/dave_gnukem/releases/tag/1.0.2 (final official SDL1-based source code - if an old downstream port needs to be on SDL1 for some reason we suggest using that 1.0.2 release)

So for builds prior to this, the dependencies would be e.g. along the lines "sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev" and "libsdl-mixer1.2-dev".

Henceforth, it should be e.g.: libsdl2-dev, libsdl2-mixer-dev

SDL2 brings various potential advantages.



## Mac OS X Build Instructions

Same as Linux - type 'make'. Run with ./davegnukem if it built correctly (and data subfolder present)

Installing Dependencies:

If using macports, you should be able to just do:

% sudo port install libsdl2

% sudo port install libsdl2_mixer

Then as with Linux, type 'make' and run with "./davegnukem" if it built correctly (and data subfolder present)

(Alternatively, you could install LibSDL2 and LibSDL-Mixer2 by downloading the source code and doing 'make' and 'make install' (as root) for each of these first).


## Windows Installer Build Instructions

To build a Windows installer, use Inno Setup 5.

Note: As of Apr 2020 it is still recommended to use the older 'version 5' of Inno Setup (and not versions 6 or higher) as Inno Setup version 6 appears to have dropped support for Windows XP, which we still support (this also indirectly allows ReactOS support)

The basic process of building a Windows installer is as follows (this process is still a little crude/unrefined and may require a bit of hackery if you're trying to do this):

* Build the source code so you have the game's .exe (updating version number and date in main.cpp if/as desired to change it)
* Set up a local folder, e.g. c:\src\gnukem\src\installer\ApplicationFolder\ which is basically a mirror of what the installed "\Program Files\Dave Gnukem" is going to look like, containing the data subfolder, .exe, DLLs, license files, README.md etc. Remember to codesign the exe and DLLs if you can.
* Open c:\src\gnukem\src\installer\gnukem.iss in Inno Setup
* Make any changes to reflect your own local build differences, e.g. if you're using a different folder location to the default c:\src\gnukem
* Update the version number
* Compile it in Inno Setup. It will generate something like Dave_Gnukem_Setup.exe ... rename to add the version number
* Code-sign the generated Setup .exe
* Test the generated Setup .exe


# Level Editor Instructions

(New 1 Jul 2017) Level Editor how-to video: https://youtu.be/xiznDqg2BHg

Note there is currently no 'undo', so be careful. If happy with a set of work, save your changes.

NB: All in-game cheat/debugging keys (eg level up) must first be turned on by pressing Ctrl+Shift+G

* NB: As of Apr 2018, you must first turn cheat/debugging stuff (Ctrl+Shift+G) on before using F4 or F5 for sprite/level editor
* F5 from within the game invokes the level editor
* F1: Save current changes (NB: there is currently no 'unsaved changes' warning, so remember to save your changes, if desired)
* Escape: Exit level editor and start playing current level
* Hold in Ctrl+Alt and click with the mouse to drop in hero and start playing/testing level at the clicked position
* X: Toggle display/editing of 'foreground layer' (there are two 'layers', the background layer primarily for solid stuff, e.g. walls, and the foreground layer generally for e.g. objects or monsters, or other semi-transparent objects)
* Z: Toggle display/editing of 'background layer'
* M,N: Previous/Next spriteset. There is a left-click and right-click "sprite palette"; clicking the left or right mouse button in the map preview area places an object from the left-click or right-click palette, respectively. Click in the spriteset with the left or mouse button to select that sprite object to either the left or right-click "sprite palette".
* To select the hero start position in the map, select and place either the 2nd-last or 3rd-last object in the first spriteset (it looks like a figure with a left or right arrow, which indicates the start direction). There should only be one of these per level.
* To place the exit position in the map, select and place the last object in the first spritset. There should only be one of these per level.
* 1-9: Macros: Float the mouse cursor in the map preview area and press one of these shortcuts to place from a few pre-defined complex objects, e.g. crates.
* F: Do a 'horizontal fill' of the current selected sprite (on the current layer)
* To choose the desired level, use the Up+L 'cheat' from within the game
* To choose the desired 'game' i.e. 'mission' (i.e. set of levels), use the main game menu 'Select mission'
* Ctrl+F6: Show level sprite instance statistics
* Ctrl+F7: Show overview of all levels, with some basic stats on 'important' gameplay items

Game Cheats Useful for Testing:

* Up+L - Next level
* Backspace+P - Get Powerboots
* Backspace+G - 'God Mode'
* Backspace+PgDn - Get all keys, access card, antivirus disk, and full firepower
* H - Damage Health

Note that for active animated objects that consist in the spriteset of multiple sprites (e.g. each conveyor belt piece has 4 sprites, for its animation), you *must* place the *first* of the four in the map for the object to work correctly.

Keep in mind that once the hero has the powerboots, he'll be able to jump higher. So there is a sort of logical progression if you place powerboots in a level, i.e. they should be placed once per 'mission' (i.e. set of levels), and levels prior to that should assume the default lower jump height, levels after that point might possibly assume the higher jump height.

To add a new 'mission' (i.e. set of levels), edit the missions.txt file and add a new line containing the name of your .gam file, e.g. "mygame/mygame.gam" (without quotes). (You should try keep all files associated with a particular game/mission in its own subfolder.) To add/remove levels for that game/mission, edit the .gam file (see the included .gam files to see the format).


# TODOs (To Sort - many done now):

* It would be really great to have packages for e.g. Debian, Ubuntu etc. (possibly two packages? one for the binary, one for the data)
* Videos?
* Check through code for possible buffer over-runs?
* 'Texture Manager':
	* Clean up of 'textures'
	* Actual hardware accel if available [todo: proper blending]
	* Restoring hardware surfaces on toggle fullscreen with DirectX (is this no longer an issue now we're on SDL? or still something one must do with SDL?) (low)
* Explosion sound doesn't always play (fixed 2016-10-22 but fix could use more testing, cf. channel -1 story)
* DEV
	* Update TargetName to DaveGnukem in VS2010
	* Set up working folders to work 'out the box', so to speak
	* Add a dev readme.txt to help devs get set up

* [med] Level Editor is hogging CPU [check sprite editor, does it also?]
* Check for all possible hardcoded keys that may be interfering with redefined keys (e.g. Ctrl, H, backspace+G etc.)
* [After redefine keys] Ctrl *both* shoot and jump
* CREDITS: Add Vytautas Shaltenis, a.k.a. rtfb, EMH, etc. [who else?]
* Some better graphics
* Signed executables in binary release?
* [check] Dying seems to reset score to 0 - is that right? Cf. DN1 behavior
* Is the -640 flag now basically obsolete? Remove? Or change to do something else useful? E.g. to make window maximum size e.g. same as monitor could be useful for level editing.

## Sprite TODOs:

* Some of the background brick colors should be a bit darker
* Some smoothing on some of hard pixely 'lines' (e.g. on shadow edges)
* Un-EGA-ish sprites that still look a bit too EGA-ish (some of the especially ones look a bit too 16-color-ish perhaps, though the original DN1 was 16 colors)
* Red background pipes look a bit .. I dunno what .. chromatic? Maybe desaturate slightly .. or something



# Notes

The name is a pun on 'Duke Nukem' and 'Gnu' as a sort of 'hat-tip'/reference to the open source license/model.

The game took forever to complete to mimic the Duke Nukem Forever model of taking forever to be released.

The underlying 'engine' supports high frame rates and smooth scrolling etc.; the reason the frame rate is artificially capped to 18fps is that the earliest versions (~1994/1995-ish) were written for 16-bit 8086/80286, which used hardware timer interrupts that ran at around 18Hz. (Though it's possible to uncap the frame-rate, the CThing's are unfortunately currently hardcoded for 18Hz, so they just run silly-fast if one uncaps the frame rate ... if writing a new game or a 'version 2' it should be easy to use a higher frame rate and write new CThing's movement code to be based on time-passed-since-last-frame or some-such. Likewise the blocky viewport scrolling itself should be easy to replace with smooth viewport-scrolling.)
