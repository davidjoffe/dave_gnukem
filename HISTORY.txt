   non-flickery, clipped main-game-viewport output. Re-added crappy bullets.

   rewriting the sprite and level interface.

1998/12/31 - Version 0.1

   Transparency functionality is in now. I have decided to release v 0.1,
   even though it is still very alpha.

1998/12/30
 - Annoying problems regarding non-existence of transparency blits in GGI.
   Will try proceed by writing my own.

1998/12/26
 - Got some more graphics stuff working, 8x8 and 16x16 bitmaps. No
   transparency yet, and several quirks, but its starting to look good.

1998/12/25
 - Struggled a lot trying to get the old-style keyboard handler (interrupt
   based) to behave with libgii, which seems to be VERY poorly documented.
   I hope I don't struggle as much converting the timer interrupt stuff.
 - The main menu works, sort of, and I'm ready to start digging into the
   actual game part.

1998/12/24
 - Gotten the code to compile in about an hour. Mostly just created a bunch
   of stubs. Lots of platform-dependent stuff there. Some badly designed
   stuff, but some quite well designed stuff also. (I wrote the original in
   my first year at university, as learning project for c/c++ :) No real C++
   there though, except the 'new' operator.

1998/12/23
 - Decide to have a go at porting djg to ggi. I reckon most the code will
   probably have to be rewritten.

1995
 - Original DOS/EGA djg started then placed on hold. Some origins from
   a previous pascal/assembler version.
