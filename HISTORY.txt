NB: See README.md for most up-to-date history as of October 2016, this file is not always updated.

2018/03/31 - Version 0.96

* [30 Mar 2018] Change volume control keys from PgUp/PgDn to 7/6 (as PgUp/PgDn conflict on some keyboards, e.g. Pandora, and also some laptops don't have 'actual' PgUp/PgDn etc.)
* [30 Mar 2018] Add 'About' page to main menu
* [30 Mar 2018] Add new F10 save screenshot function (saves on Windows under \Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\DaveGnukem\screenshots and on Linux under $HOME/.gnukem/screenshots)
* [26 Mar 2018] Bugfixes and level improvements (also fixed a level bug where one of the levels was impossible to complete)
* [22 Mar 2018] Boot sprite; Improve Dr Proetton (Dr Proton) sprite and behavior
* [20 Mar 2018] Fix overly-large window if Windows DPI scaling settings are enabled (unfortunately the fix breaks Windows XP support - but you can enable djWINXP_SUPPORT in config.h if you want to generate a build that supports Windows XP)

2018/03/11 - Version 0.91

* [11 Mar 2018] Create a Windows installer
* [22 Jan 2018] Add 'easter egg' [arin_j stream viewer suggestion]
* [22 Jan 2018] Level editor highlights instances of selected sprite (yellow), and sprite selection mouse-over sprite (cyan) (F3 toggles this ON/OFF if/when it gets annoying)
* [13 Jan 2018] New slightly experimental map auto-shadows and sprite auto-drop-shadows
* [13 Jan 2018] New shortcut keys Shift+F8/F9: Toggle map and sprite auto-shadows on/off, respectively
* Overhauled shooting/bullets code
* Level Editor: New "Ctrl+F7" command shows overview of all levels, and some basic stats on 'important' gameplay items
* Ctrl+Shift+W Large gameplay viewport mode (currently classified as a 'cheat')
* All cheat keys (and debug/testing keys like H to inflict self-damage) must now first be enabled by pressing Ctrl+Shift+G to enable in-game debugging stuff
* New cheat Backspace+PgUp increases firepower by one (added for testing)
* Numerous bugfixes and gameplay tweaks

2017/08/12 - Version 0.81

* Add water
* Add very basic Dr Proetton ('final boss') and basic foundations of game ending sequence when you beat Dr Proetton
* Add jump-monster
* Add rockets
* Level Editor: New "Ctrl+Alt+N" command to generate a new blank level (NB: Still needs to be added manually to default.gam!)
* Fix a couple of bugs relating to jump height and powerboots

2017/08/05 - Version 0.72

* Add new 'sort of looks like a cannon on wheels' monster type
* Implemented new inventory pickup item 'antivirus disk' and corresponding 'master computer' (when we insert AV disk into master computer we save the world) (should only be one of each of these, and in last level of a 'mission')
* Add new high-voltage "barrier" that must be shot multiple times to destroy before hero can pass through (touching it results in immediate death)
* Add new monster that constitutes the approximate equivalent of DN1 rabbits (for now, or maybe permanently, this is just a sort of 'evil Tux' - not sure yet if placeholder sprite, or part of plot)
* Add new floor type that auto-crumbles after hero walks or jumps twice on it (2nd spriteset, position 5x4 - place only 1 block per segment)
* Re-do instructions screens to display storyline/plot
* Basic more proper/correct implementation of the CAcme falling blocks
* Fixed: Bullets go through doors

2017/06/22 - Version 0.71 [Windows only]:

* New keyboard shortcuts: Shift+F6/F7: Dec/Inc speed (framerate)
* Fix soda can not animating

2017/06/22 - Version 0.70 [Windows only]

* Add new basic 'Instructions' option to in-game menu
* Fix: Potential game 'freeze' in teleporter if exiting level editor (or holding in action key)
* Added "-scale N" command line option (1 = 320x200, 2=640x400, etc.) (if passed, this overrides the default behavior of attempting to "intelligently" select the scale factor based on e.g. desktop resolution etc.)
* Fix: "Key polling behavior is subtly incorrect" (this should slightly improve the character control, especially if trying to move left/right one block only)
* Minor sprite and level improvements
* Add hero jump/landing sounds (credit for the sounds: Juhani Junkala), key pick-up sound, and more
* Increase gameplay viewport width from 12 to 13 blocks

* Better hero shooting sound

2016/10/22 - Version 0.63 / 0.64 / 0.65

2016/10/16 - Version 0.62

* Get Dave Gnukem compiling and running on Mac OS X: https://www.livecoding.tv/david_joffe/videos/jbBvb-dave-gnukem-c-game-side-scrolling-shooter-9
* Miscellaneous minor aesthetic improvements

2016/10/10 - Version 0.61

* Fix: "Dying in the pungee sticks will often cause a crash" (thank you to porter who pointed that out)
* Fix a segfault in Linux (possibly VNC only?) when navigating in-game menus and other sub-menus
* Add semi-experimental 'big viewport mode' (Backspace + B in game to toggle) to make level creation/testing easier for level editors

   non-flickery, clipped main-game-viewport output. Re-added crappy bullets.

1998/12/31
 - Started adding basics for new level and graphics editor. Am busy
   rewriting the sprite and level interface.

1998/12/31 - Version 0.1
 - After transparency fiasco I have begun conversion to DirectBuffer's.
   Transparency functionality is in now. I have decided to release v 0.1,
   even though it is still very alpha.

1998/12/30
 - Annoying problems regarding non-existence of transparency blits in GGI.
   Will try proceed by writing my own.

1998/12/26
 - Got some more graphics stuff working, 8x8 and 16x16 bitmaps. No
   transparency yet, and several quirks, but its starting to look good.

1998/12/25
 - Struggled a lot trying to get the old-style keyboard handler (interrupt
   based) to behave with libgii, which seems to be VERY poorly documented.
   I hope I don't struggle as much converting the timer interrupt stuff.
 - The main menu works, sort of, and I'm ready to start digging into the
   actual game part.

1998/12/24
 - Gotten the code to compile in about an hour. Mostly just created a bunch
   of stubs. Lots of platform-dependent stuff there. Some badly designed
   stuff, but some quite well designed stuff also. (I wrote the original in
   my first year at university, as learning project for c/c++ :) No real C++
   there though, except the 'new' operator.

1998/12/23
 - Decide to have a go at porting djg to ggi. I reckon most the code will
   probably have to be rewritten.

1995 [david]
 - Original DOS/EGA djg started then placed on hold. Some origins from
   a previous pascal/assembler version. C/C++ version initiated.

1994/02/22 [david]
 - Crude origins as a 16-bit x86 assembler implementation
