I'm not a fan of the various globals here; they're mostly from the very
oldest parts of the codebase, when I was still an inexperienced coder ...
but not necessarily at this stage worth investing time in refactoring,
unless we want to genericize this codebase more/better for other derived
games. [dj2018]

	//! x,y = Hero's absolute y position in level (in level block coordinates, not pixel units) (0,0 = upper left of level)
	int y;

	//! If x_small is 0 then hero is at 'x', if 1 then hero is at x+8 pixels (or to be more specific, an extra half-block offset in the x direction, whatever the block width in pixels) ... this is slightly quite specific-ish to DN1/DaveGnukem style of movement, in a generic 2D platformer I might not want it - in that case, we might want to derive e.g. CPlayerGnukem from e.g. CPlayer and put it in the derived class as a possible solution to doing things generically. Note that when this code was created, many compilers didn't have 'bool' type in C++, that's why it was represented as an int.

	// This m_nFalltime thing is to make hero fall initially slower
	// then faster (full block at a time).
	// Apart from looking/feeling slightly more natural, it also 'masks'
	// an issue with smooth vertical movement enabled where you get a jerky
	// effect that looks like hero bouncing jerkily up and down when falling
	// off bottom of view, as the view code scrolls vertically always in increments of 16 pixels,
	// whereas if hero falls at 8 pixels off bottom then relative vertical offset
	// of hero on screen toggles 8 pixels each consecutive frame. With
	// this falltime thing, by the time he is falling off the bottom,
	// he is falling 16 pixels, and the view scrolls 16 pixels too.
	// It's a bit fiddly but anyway, we have to do fine tweaks like this.

This stuff has to do with the particular way DN1's viewport scrolling worked; either the horizontal game viewport is aligned to the 16-pixel boundaries (in which case this is 0), or it's further offset by half a block i.e. 8 pixels, depending.)

//! hero animation image index offset [dj2020-06 naively one might think this belongs in CPlayer, but really it's more to do with the CPlayer 'visual' - so maybe belongs in a separate class - not important]

//! Immediately after firing weapon, the hero sprite is drawn slightly differently
//! briefly, which gives almost a slight 'recoil/kickback' visual effect, this ugly
//! global variable is to simulate that (this is based on the animation behaviour in
//! DN1, where it does that).
//! The visual behaviour still needs a little tweaking, it's not quite correct - in DN1
//! when 'resting', the hero normally returns to a 'stand-still position', and the
//! on-fired-weapon offset is relative to that ... in ours, we 'incorrectly' don't return
//! to standstill (e.g. may 'rest' with one foot forward as if halfway through walking)
//! so for now we just add a relative offset from whatever the current sprite is [low - dj2018-01]
//! (Design-wise, there should probably be some sort of hero class or something (or two
//! classes, e.g. a hero 'state' and hero 'view', e.g. Model/View/Controller paradigm),
//! and e.g. Nukem/Gnukem-specific stuff like this could be in derived classes from those
//! ... that's extremely low-prio, I'll probably never bother doing that. ~dj2018-01)
