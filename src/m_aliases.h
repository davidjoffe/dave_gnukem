 *
 * Desciption: a definition of few aliasing typenames. Removed from
 *		sys_defs.h by request of YvL.
 *
 * dj2022-01 Removing unused aliases as some e.g. byte were unused anyway in our codebase and cause conflicts with e.g. std::byte on newer c++ versions e.g. c++17 .. if we need similar things again we can create new ones and/or rather use the newer c++ types
